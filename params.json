{"name":"5chan_scope documentation","tagline":"","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\n`5chan_scope` is a multichannel audiovisual composition. It explores the intersection of sound and image by displaying x/y plots of the waveforms for each pair of channels. That is, everything that is seen is a direct, raw ‘translation’ of the audio. The audio, in turn, is designed with the sole purpose of generating engaging visual results.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, I knew I wanted to use the visual element of the piece to display an exact representation of the sonic component. I’d experimented with lissajous figures in previous pieces, and wanted to see how far I could push the idea of drawing interesting patterns using only the sample values of waveforms.\r\n\r\nThis video shows an old lissajous pattern experiment.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/66002892\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThis is a music video I made at the end of 2nd year for Ben Potts, again featuring lissajous patterns prominently.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/66204331\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nNeither of these old experiments used audio signals to generate the lissajous patterns. The first step of this project was to create a way of generating these patterns using audio, which led to one of the most fundamental guiding principles of the piece:\r\n\r\nIt was important that the piece did not become merely ‘music with a visualiser’. To prevent this, the visualiser and music were constructed so as to be mutually beneficial to one another. The music was generated with attention to cross-correlation patterns between each pair of channels, with particular care given to the order and relative positions of each of the cross-correlation 'grid cells’. If the music were played through a different visualiser, the results would be much less cohesive. Similarly, if different music were played through the `5chan_scope` visualiser, it would likely produce no memorable cross-correlation patterns. This need for inter-reliance between music and visual was represented by the following guiding heuristics:\r\n\r\n> All decisions immediately affecting sound should be made with the sole purpose of improving the visual spectacle. All decisions immediately affecting the visuals should be made with the sole purpose of increasing sonic impact. Where a sonic choice will not affect the graphical outcome, take either choice. Where a graphical choice will not affect the sound, take either choice.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the visuals and sound were developed as a single entity, rather than following the more conventional approach of developing visuals, then developing sound, then putting the two together.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
